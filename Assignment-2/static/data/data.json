    "data":"Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into your arteries. A blood pressure measurement is a test that measures the force (pressure) in your arteries as your heart pumps. Blood pressure is measured as two numbers: Systolic blood pressure (the first and higher number) measures pressure inside your arteries when the heart beats. Diastolic blood pressure (the second and lower number) measures the pressure inside the artery when the heart rests between beats. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, affects tens of millions of adults in the United States. It increases the risk of life-threatening conditions including heart attack and stroke. But high blood pressure rarely causes symptoms. A blood pressure measurement helps diagnose high blood pressure early, so it may be treated before it leads to serious complications.",
